## 
# This sample adds an SQS queue and an alarm on queue depth to the environment.
#  It does not provide credentials for accessing that queue or on-instance scripts.
#
# Customers would generally not edit this file.
# Instead, they would have another file sitting in the same directory (or anywhere) with 
#  an option-settings section such as the following (all of these are showing the default value)
#
# option-settings:
#  "aws:elasticbeanstalk:customoption" :
#     VisibilityTimeout : 30
#     AlarmEmail : nobody@amazon.com
